# Salary Prediction with Simple Linear Regression

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between Years of Experience and Salary using a simple linear regression model. The dataset includes information about individuals' years of experience and their corresponding salaries.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is [Salary_dataset.csv](/kaggle/input/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression/Salary_dataset.csv). It includes the following columns:
- YearsExperience: Number of years of experience
- Salary: Corresponding salary

## Analysis
- A linear regression model was trained on the dataset to predict salary based on years of experience.
- The model achieved a high R-squared score of approximately 0.96, indicating a strong correlation between years of experience and salary.

## Code
The Jupyter Notebook [linear_regression_salary_prediction.ipynb](/path/to/your/notebook.ipynb) contains the code used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage
To run the code:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook.
