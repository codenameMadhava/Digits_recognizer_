Boston Housing Dataset
Overview
This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. It was obtained from the StatLib archive (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston), and has been used extensively throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms.

Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

crim: per capita crime rate by town
zn: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
indus: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
chas: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
nox: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
rm: average number of rooms per dwelling
age: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
dis: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
rad: index of accessibility to radial highways
tax: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
ptratio: pupil-teacher ratio by town
b: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of [people of African American descent] by town
lstat: lower status of the population (percent)
medv: median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable)
Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values:
The 'rm' column contained 5 missing values. These rows were dropped from the dataset.
Train-Test Split:
The data was split into training and testing sets with a test size of 35% and a random state of 42.
Feature Scaling:
The features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
Model Training
Linear Regression Model:
A linear regression model was trained using the training data.
Cross-Validation:
Cross-validation was performed with 10 folds to evaluate the model's performance. The negative mean squared error (MSE) was used as the scoring metric.
Model Evaluation:
The trained model was evaluated on the test set using the coefficient of determination (R-squared) metric.
Results
Mean squared error (MSE) from cross-validation: -28.57
R-squared score on the test set: 0.745
